# Flexible Virtual School

Welcome to the Flexible Virtual School project. This repository contains the documentation and implementation details for the virtual school system designed to teach the Arabic language to both native and non-native speakers using modern internet technologies.

## Project Overview

The Flexible Virtual School aims to provide an accessible and effective platform for teaching the Arabic language. By leveraging technologies like virtual life, web services, and interactive tools, the virtual school offers flexible courses and optimizes educational resources.

## Introduction

The Flexible Virtual School project involves the design and development of an online platform aimed at making Arabic language education more accessible and effective. The project is structured into four phases:

1. **Problem Definition**: Understanding the challenges and requirements of creating a virtual school.
2. **System Architecture Document**: Developing a scalable and secure architecture for the virtual school.
3. **System Design Document**: Detailed design of system components, including user interfaces and backend processes.
4. **Final Report and Oral Presentation**: Documenting the final report and preparing for the oral presentation.

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Problem Definition

In this phase, we analyze the problem domain, identify the challenges, and propose solutions to address them. Key topics covered include:

- Project Description
- Purpose
- Problem Domain Analysis
- Problems to be Addressed
- Addressing the Problems
- Concepts and Vocabulary
- System Context View
  - Scenario 1: Student Application for Diploma
  - Scenario 2: Instructor Conducts an Exam
- Functions & Non-Functional Properties
  - Functional Properties
  - Non-Functional Properties
- Challenges
- Projection

For detailed documentation, please refer to the [Phase 1: Problem Definition](docs/ProblemDefinition.md).

### Phase 2: System Architecture Document

This phase focuses on designing the system architecture, making key design decisions, and creating models to represent the system. Key topics include:

- Methodology
- System Architecture
- Design Decisions
- Domain Model
- Architectural Style
- Considered and Rejected Alternatives
- Structural Model
- User Interface
- Non-Functional Properties
- Quality Assurance
- Future Considerations

For detailed documentation, please refer to the [Phase 2: System Architecture Document](docs/SystemArchitectureDocument.md).

### Phase 3: System Design Document

In this phase, we provide detailed designs for each system component, including structural and dynamic models. Key topics include:

- Detailed System Architecture
- Detailed Structural Model
  - Object Diagram
  - Analysis Diagram
  - View of Participating Classes (VOPC)
- Dynamic Model
  - Sequence Diagrams
  - State Diagrams

For detailed documentation, please refer to the [Phase 3: System Design Document](docs/SystemDesignDocument.md).

### Phase 4: Final Report and Oral Presentation

In this phase, we compile the final report and prepare for the oral presentation. Key topics include:

- Summary of Phases
- Results and Findings
- Conclusion and Future Work
- Implementation Considerations
- Architecture Analysis and Testing
- Personal Reflection

For detailed documentation, please refer to the [Phase 4: Final Report and Oral Presentation](docs/FinalReportAndOralPresentation.md).
